NJWO LEAGUE OWNERS (POP-UP) MEETING - FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 2016 - 4-7 PM
________________________________________________________________________________________

I'm sending this out to the entire NJWO, though I know that some of y'all can't participate this time, but I want everyone to know: if you're in the NJWO, and you visit San Francisco during football season, that is an instant reason—and a perfect excuse—for a pop-up League Owners Meeting! You’re always invited!

CY-on-the-Fly (Gamblers) and Beto (Bandidos) will be in SFO on Friday, November 11th, for a concert at the Civic Center, and the NJWO is convening its second ever League Owners Meeting, from 4pm to 7pm.

We'll be starting in the Financial District, at The Royal Exchange (info below), and then with foot power and/or Uber, start moving the party uptown closer and closer to the Civic! 

I'm sending this first invite out to all the owners, just FYI. I'll send another reminder on Tuesday or Wednesday, just to the locals. (I will also put up something on Facebook, for those of you connected there.)

If you can make it, even for just one round, I think it would be great. Let me know!

There's nothing better than meeting your competitors, and getting to know a little about them face-to-face. 

I think, over the years, we've assembled a great league, with a group of really smart, successful, competitive, and friendly gentlemen, who are masters and professionals of business, law, finance, technology, publishing, and football... (OK, maybe not last one, none of us are the "Theo Epsteins" of the NFL, we're not building real teams here.)

So let's get together for a quick adult beverage or two—or five—whenever we have a critical mass of NJWO all within the same city limits.

And again, anytime you come to San Franciso, let me know and we'll organize an impromptu NJWO get-together.

If you’re in town on Friday, November 11th, I hope you can join us!


Out,

.LAG (aka Da Commish)
